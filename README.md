## Overview

As tech newbies, how can we be empowered to make greener choices? Letâ€™s start with a git push!  
Utilizing National Grid's Carbon Intensity API, we make an app to inform you when is the best time to push your code to Github (or to do other energy-consuming activities)

## Tech Stack
React, Chart.js
## Future improvements
- Send a reminder (email, slack)
- Or can turn this idea into a vscode extension to keep track of coding time and when is best time to push code to save energy.
